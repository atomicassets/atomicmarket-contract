# Test-only fixture: a minimal EXTERNAL contract that reads atomicassets tables
# through include/atomicassets-interface.hpp. Catches header regressions the
# main suite cannot see (atomicassets itself never includes that header) — e.g.
# the get_self()-vs-ATOMICASSETS_ACCOUNT anchoring bug fixed in PR #21. Consumed
# by the "Interface Header" VeRT tests; NOT a release artifact.

# Release-only ABI normalization. CDT 4.1 changed two -abigen spellings
# (pair fields first/second; vector<uint8_t> as `bytes`) that break existing
# integrations. The VeRT test suite is written against the raw CDT 4.1 abi, so we
# patch ONLY for distribution/on-chain deploy — never for the test build. The wasm
# is identical either way (abi labels don't affect the binary wire format).

# Build the distributable artifacts (wasm + legacy-compatible abi) for release /
# `cleos set contract`. Do NOT use for running tests — use `make build`.
# Sequence build -> patch-abi via sub-makes so `make -j release` cannot start
# patch-abi before build has produced build/atomicassets.abi.
