"""Restore the legacy ABI spellings after CDT >= 4.1 -abigen.

Background
----------
The AtomicMarket contract deployed on WAX mainnet (like the AtomicAssets contract
it builds on) was compiled with an older CDT. Modern CDT (4.1.x) changed two
-abigen spellings in wire-compatible but tool-visible ways. ABI field/type *names*
are how external tools (atomicmarket-js, wallets, the ECA indexer, cleos JSON)
pack/unpack data, so each change breaks existing integrations even though the
compiled wasm and the binary wire format are identical. This script restores the
deployed spellings; the wasm is untouched.

Two regressions are reverted:

1. std::pair fields  `first`/`second`  ->  `key`/`value`
   (the `ATTRIBUTE_MAP` element type `pair_string_ATOMIC_ATTRIBUTE`, pulled in via
   atomicdata.hpp). Old CDT named pair fields key/value; CDT 4.1 hardcodes the C++
   member names.

2. std::vector<uint8_t>  `bytes`  ->  `uint8[]`
   Old CDT spelled vector<uint8_t> as `uint8[]` and vector<int8_t> as `bytes`;
   CDT 4.1 collapses BOTH to `bytes`. The legacy ABIs keep `bytes` only for the
   `INT8_VEC` alias (vector<int8_t>), so we convert every `bytes` EXCEPT that one.

(The spelling rules were originally verified byte-for-byte against the deployed
atomicassets ABI via https://wax.greymass.com get_abi; the same legacy-CDT
spellings apply to the deployed atomicmarket ABI, which shares these types
through atomicdata / the atomicassets interface.)

Idempotent. Usage: patch-abi.py [path/to/contract.abi]  (default build/atomicmarket.abi)
