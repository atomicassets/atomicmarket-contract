# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

AtomicAssets is an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) standard for EOSIO / Antelope blockchains. This is a C++ smart contract that extents the Atomic Assets standard, supporting the sales and rentals of said NFTs, alongside royalty distribution across various parties, through decentralized secondary marketplaces.

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Contract Implementation**: Main contract logic in `src/atomicmarket.cpp`
- **Header Files**: Core definitions in `include/atomicmarket.hpp`, delphioracle definitions in `delphioracle-interface.hpp`
- **Interface**: Contract interface defined in `include/atomicassets-interface.hpp`

### Key Concepts

- **Collections**: NFTs are grouped by collections rather than authors, allowing flexible authorizations
- **Schemas**: Define extensible data structures used for serialization
- **Templates**: Store reusable data that can be referenced by assets to save RAM
- **Assets**: Always belong to a collection and schema, optionally reference a template
- **Data Serialization**: Custom Protobuf-inspired serialization to reduce RAM costs

## Build Commands

### Building the Contract
```bash
mkdir build
cdt-cpp -abigen -contract=atomicassets -I./include src/atomicassets.cpp -o build/atomicassets.wasm
```

## Testing

### Test Framework
- Uses Vert framework for EOSIO contract testing (migrated from Hydra)
- Tests written in JavaScript using Jest
- Test configuration in `jest.config.js` with 10-minute timeout

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test        # Run all tests
jest [pattern]  # Run specific test files matching pattern
```

### Test Structure
Tests are organized in directories by functionality:
- `tests/Admin Actions/` - Administrative operations
- `tests/Asset Actions/` - Asset creation and management
- `tests/Collection Actions/` - Collection management
- `tests/Schema Actions/` - Schema operations
- `tests/Template Actions/` - Template management
- `tests/Transfer-Offer Actions/` - Transfer and trading functionality
- `tests/Deposit-Withdraw-Back-Burn Actions/` - Token backing operations

### Test Files
Each test file follows the pattern `[action].test.js` and uses Vert framework for blockchain simulation.

## Code Formatting
```bash
npm run prettier  # Format JavaScript test files
```

## Development Notes

- Contract uses EOSIO CDT (Contract Development Toolkit)
- RAM efficiency is a key design principle - assets cost only 151 bytes
- All user operations are RAM-free for end users
- Contract supports notifications to other smart contracts for game integration
- Trade offers are implemented natively for peer-to-peer marketplaces
